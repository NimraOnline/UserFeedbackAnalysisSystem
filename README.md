## Project Overview
EduTech is an innovative educational application that offers a variety of online courses to students across the globe. As users engage with the app's content and features, they often leave feedback about their experiences. The EduTech team recognizes the importance of understanding user sentiments and preferences to continuously improve the app's offerings.

## Business Objectives
> Enhancing User Experience: The primary goal of EduTech is to provide a seamless and enriching learning experience to its users. By analyzing user feedback, the company aims to identify pain points and areas of improvement within the app.

> Course Customization: EduTech offers a wide range of courses, and the company's second goal is to tailor course offerings based on user preferences. By mining feedback data, they intend to gain insights into which courses resonate most with users and why.

>Engagement Optimization: Keeping users engaged is crucial for the success of any app. EduTech's third goal is to optimize user engagement by understanding the factors that contribute to positive user experiences, as well as identifying patterns that lead to disengagement.
